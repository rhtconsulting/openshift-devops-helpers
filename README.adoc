Helper scripts to assist in the integration of OpenShift functions into a process tool of the user's choice.

WARNING: These scripts were built for specific environments to make use of JIRA as a tool to formalize and control the release and promotion process in OpenShift. They are not yet in a form suitable for casual usage.

== Requirements

* These scripts must exist in the source code repository together with the existing code.
* The build server used to assemble the application must have an appropriate version of the oc client installed.

== Usage

<tbd>

== Contribution guidelines
* Tests
** There are currently no tests for these scripts. Contributions and suggestions(in that order ;) are welcome.

== Acknowledgements
* Yeo Boo Kian (@bookian) - the original author of these scripts.
* Hoo Chuan Wu (chhoo@redhat.com) - creator of the JIRA workflows that use these scripts.
